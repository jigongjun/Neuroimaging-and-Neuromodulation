# Neuroimaging-and-Neuromodulation

This package has two GUI-based tools (WhiteMatter and TMStarget) with common functions.

# WhiteMatter toolbox
 
It was developed for functional analsysis of brain white matter. 

# TMStarget toolbox

It was developed for computing the individualized target of rTMS. 

# Requriement:
This is a matlab toolbox. To use the full function of this package, you should add additional fMRI tools in your compute.
1) AFQ: https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ (for bundle-based WM function analysis)
2) vistasoft:  https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft (for bundle-based WM function analysis)
3) FSL: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/  (not necessory for TMStarget user)
4) SPM12: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/
