# Neuroimaging-and-Neuromodulation

Neuroimage has been used to investigate how the brain works for decades. But only in the past 10 years, fMRI has become a promising way to guide clinical treatment, such as repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) for major depression disorder. In this background, we initiated a Neuroimaging-and-Neruomodulation project that aimed to develop a toolbox connecting imaging findings to rTMS treatment. Recently, we have developed two GUI-based tools, WhiteMatter and TMStarget.

# WhiteMatter toolbox
 
It was developed for functional analsysis of brain white matter. 

# TMStarget toolbox

It was developed for computing the individualized target of rTMS. 

# Requriement:
This is a matlab toolbox. To use the full function of this package, you should add additional fMRI tools in your compute.
1) AFQ: https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ (for bundle-based WM function analysis)
2) vistasoft:  https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft (for bundle-based WM function analysis)
3) FSL: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/  (not necessory for TMStarget user)
4) SPM12: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/
